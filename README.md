# Computer Architecture and Assembly Language Course 2nd Semester, NASM tasks

This repository contains my solutions to programming tasks for the Computer Architecture and Assembly Language course in the 2nd semester at the Computational Mathematics and Cybernetics department of Moscow State University (CMC MSU). The tasks are implemented using the NASM assembler and are organized by the contest number and problem name.

The repository contains directories for each contest, where each directory contains the NASM source code files for the corresponding task.

Feel free to use these solutions as a reference and to compare against your own solutions. However, please do not copy them directly, as that would be a violation of the academic integrity policies of CMC MSU or your institution.

## Requirements

To run the solution files, you will need to have the NASM assembler installed on your system. You can download the NASM assembler from the official website: https://www.nasm.us/.
